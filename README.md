## Objective

As a Data Analyst employed by a Real Estate Investment Trust, my goal is to facilitate the Trust's entry into the Residential real estate market. To achieve this, I will analyze a dataset containing house sale prices for King County, including Seattle, from May 2014 to May 2015. My primary task is to determine the market value of houses based on various attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more. By completing ten questions provided in a template notebook, I will utilize data analysis techniques to predict housing prices accurately and provide valuable insights for the Trust's investment decisions.
